# Route-Visualizer

A route visualizer using the MapQuest Directions API and Static Map API to allow user to input starting and ending location and draw a route onto a map and output overall distance

Key points:
- The distance is not 100% accurate so take caution of this.
- Uses additional Requests Library so may have to install through "pip install requests" in command line.
- First time making and interacting with APIs like this.


Potential Improvements:
- Allow user to choose to avoid Tolls, ferries, highways etc
- Output estimated time to travel from point a to b

Feel free to use this code as I'm still learning and may be of use to anyone who encounters it.
